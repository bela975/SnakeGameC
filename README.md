# External libraries used
## CLI-LIB
cli-lib : https://github.com/tgfb/cli-lib/blob/main/README.md

Cli-lib is a library created for developing C applications and games and with it we will manage the player's screens and inputs via the keyboard peripheral.

To use it, we just need to take the source and header files from this repository and add them to our program, replacing the main in this repository with our main.

# Requirements

 The cli-lib library works with the follwing OS: <br/>
      Linux based (Ubuntu, etc)<br/>
      MacOS<br/>
 therefore, it is necessary to have GCC installed to be able to develop the game.
